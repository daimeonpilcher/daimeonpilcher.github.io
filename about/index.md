<img src="/images/websitephoto.jpg" style="padding-right: 15px; height: 250px; min-width: 50px;" align="left"> Hi and welcome to my site!

I'm a highly experienced IT professional turned junior developer!  Herein lay the chronicles of my life.  A bit boring at times, but also very exciting, scary, tumultuous, joyous, and enlightening!

Here you'll get to see projects that I'm working on, hear about my progress, what I'm learning and doing.  Just for good measure I'll try to teach based on what I've learned.  I'll chronical my journey from San Francisco to Denver and provide flashback insights into my past.    

At {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 1981 }} years old, I have a rich and full life behind and in front of me.  There's a lot of ground to cover, so feel free to check in, read my blog, and comment on what you find interesting!
