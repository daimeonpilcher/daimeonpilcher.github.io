In April of this year (2015) I took a Web Development Immersive (WDI) course through [General Assembly][c5315a22], which is a 12 intensive week program teaching everything from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Angular.js, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, RESTful routing, and creating and using third party APIs.

I had three awesome instructors: [Delmer Reed](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/delmer-reed/9a/b53/5b3) who was the Lead Instructor, [Nathan Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thisisnathan), and [Ilias Tsangaris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliastsangaris), and three awesome Developers in Residence (DiRs): [Vikash Parekh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikashparekh), [Ryan Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilsonryanc), and [Brianna Veenstra](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/brianna-veenstra/a5/5b9/8b7) (now an instructor).  To say the least these instructors and DiRs and the numerous teaching assistants were amazing.  We learned a lot that will help us in our future careers.

Another awesome benefit of the services provided are career counseling and a [public profile](https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/daimeonpilcher) searchable by any potential employers showcasing an example of our work.

Anyways this is only the beginning and there's much much more to come!
